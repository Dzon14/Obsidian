Disruptive technology is **an innovation that significantly alters the way that consumers, industries, or businesses operate**. A disruptive technology sweeps away the systems or habits it replaces because it has attributes that are recognizably superior.

1. Substantial fraction of market must prefer the new product or service. (The new technology must prevail)
2. Incumbent (leader) must be unable to respond and replicate.
