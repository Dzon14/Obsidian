# Value theorems
**Initial value theorem:**
$$ f(0) = \lim_{t\to0} f(t) = \lim_{s\to\infty} sF(s)$$
**Final value theorem:**
$$\lim_{t\to\infty} f(t)= \lim_{s\to0} sF(s)$$
- F is the signal being investigated.
- When we have systems with RHP zeroes, the system is going in the "wrong way" before going the right way. Hence, unstable.
- $sF(s)$ must be asymptotic stable for the **Final value theorem**.
