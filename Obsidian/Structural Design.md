### Structural Design
This is a schematic at block level dsecribed in text. We describe which component or module that should be in this diagram and how they are connected.
In code we use the name "component" instead of "entity"
We use port and port maps which tells us how everything should be connected (input for ex)
#### Example of a two bit adder

#### Benefit of Structural Design 
- Large systems can be broken into smaller pieces
- We can reuse components
- We can create hierarchical designs
- There exist tools that can translate a block schematic to structural [[VHDL]] description
