## Stability margins
The margin towards the [[Stabilitet|stability]] limit. 

## Gain and phase margin
$A_{m}$ - the gain margine, amplitude margine
		- How much gain that can be reached without reaching instability.
		$$A_{m}= \frac{1}{\lvert G_{0}(i \omega _0) \rvert}$$
$\varphi _{m}$ - phase margine
		- How much phase shift can be decreased without passing the stability limit.
$$\varphi _{m}= \pi+ argG_{0}(i \omega_c)$$

## Delay Margin
The delay margin determines the length of an added delay required to drive the control loop unstable. The delay margin has no interpretations as a distance in the Nyquist plot, as we have seen for the gain and phase margins.
