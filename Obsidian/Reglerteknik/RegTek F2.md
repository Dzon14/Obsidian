# Reglerteknik F2 - Process models
Dynamical models of input/output models. 
Two types of useful models. 

There are two predominant ways to obtain a dynamical model of a process. One is to calculate the model through mass balances, energy balances, force and moment equilibria etc. The other way is to conduct experiments on the process. Most often, a combination of these two methods is used
