## PID-controller
Proportional integral derivative controller
- control loop employing feedback. 
- The most common regulator/controller

Uses different [[Control strategies]] (See all).

- The proportional part ([[Proportional control strategy|P-delen]]) contributes with the controlling signal (styrsignal) which is proportional to the actual controlling error. 
- The Integral part ([[Integral control strategy|I-delen]]) is the memory of the PID. 
- The derivation part ([[Proportional control strategy|P-delen]]) predicts future errors.
