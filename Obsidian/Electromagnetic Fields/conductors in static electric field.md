# Conductors in Static Electric Field
#### [[Electrostatics|electrostatic]] properties
1. The net (total) electric field $\vec{E} = 0$ inside a [[Conductor]]
	- An external electric field $\vec{E}_{0}$ applied
	- free electrons (negative) start to move towards $\vec{E}_{0}$ to the surface
	- Induced field $\vec{E}_{1}$ is formed by charge movements
	- $\vec{E}_1$ increases until it cancels $\vec{E}_{0}$ inside the conductor
	- $\vec{E} = 0 = \frac{\vec{F}}{q}$ inside conductor, meaning no net fo rce on free internal charges. (static/equilibrium)
2. Net charge densit $\rho = 0$ inside a conductor.
	- Proven with [[Gauss law]] (point form): $$\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_{0}} = 0 \Rightarrow \rho = 0$$
3. Any net charge appears on the surface
4. The entire conductor has equipotential
	- Proven by using the definition of [[Electric potential]]:
		  for $p_{1}, p_{2}$ in the conductor $$\nabla V (p_{1} \rightarrow p_{2}) = V(p_{2})-V(p_{2}) = - \int\limits_{p_{1}}^{p_{2}} \vec{E} \cdot \ d \vec{l} = 0, \text{ since } \vec{E} = 0$$
5. $\vec{E}$ is **perpendicular** (or normal) to the surface, just outside the surface.
	- True by the definition of electrostatics:
	Implies that we can't have the tangential component to surface ($\neq 0$).
