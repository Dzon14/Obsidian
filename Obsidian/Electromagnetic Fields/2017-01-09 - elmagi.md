Answer: C. It's not identical everywhere, since the [[Electric field]] is 0 for half the 3D space (x < 0) for the case with an infinitely large ground plane.

Answer: E. This problem is solved by recognizing that there are 3 image charges and that each image contributes to one of the 3 terms in the electric force equation. The 2 images across the 2 flat surfaces provide attractive forces, whereas the image across the right angled point leads to a repulsive force.
