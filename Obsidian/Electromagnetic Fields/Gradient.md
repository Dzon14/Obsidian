# Gradient
Defined as the vector field that represents both the magnitude($\frac{dV}{dn}$) and the direction of the maximum rate of increase of the scalar field in 3D $$grad \ V \overset{\Delta}{=} \vec{a_{n}} \frac{dV}{dn}$$
where $grad \ V = \nabla V$.
Gradient $\rightarrow$ maximum slope (magnitude and direction)
$dn$ is the shortest distance from a point $V$ to $V + dV$.

**Proof**
