# [[dielectrics]] in Static Electric Field
No free electrons, but bounded ones.

1) $\vec{E}_{0}$ can cause the positive/negative charges to be displaced in opposite direction $\Rightarrow$ induced electric dipoles by "stretching" the atom.
2) Some [[dielectrics]] have permament [[electric dipole]] behaviour even without any external field $\Rightarrow$ polar molecules, eg. $H_{2}O$ molecules. These are not aligned to one another in general. However, an external field $\vec{E}_{0}$ will cause a polar molecule to align itself with the field.
3)  Some polar molecules are permanently aligned $\rightarrow$ $\vec{E}_{1} \neq 0$, despise not having any external field, $\vec{E} = 0$. Such [[dielectrics|dielectric]] materials are called "**electrets**". We can make electrets with wax - subject to $\vec{E}_{0}$ in liquid form $\rightarrow$ let the wax solidifies.
