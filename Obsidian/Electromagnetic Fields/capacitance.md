# Capacitance
- Capacitance is a physical property of the two-conductor system
- The system is separated by vacuum or [[dielectrics]].

Concept of capacitance of one or more conductors derived from the relationship between electric charges $Q$ and the [[electric potential]] $V$.

Increasing $Q \Rightarrow$ proportional increase in $\rho_{s}(\vec{R}')(Q \propto \rho_{s})$ as charge distribution **does not** change
At point P, $$V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{0}} \oint\limits_{S'}^{} \frac{\rho_{s}(\vec{R}')ds'}{\lvert \vec{R} -  \vec{R}'\rvert}$$
Point P can be on the conductio (equipotential).
We also get
$$\begin{flalign} \Rightarrow &Q \propto V \\ &Q = C V  \end{flalign}$$
where C is capacitance - in farad $[F]\ / \ [\frac{C}{V}]$.

In this case, $C = \frac{Q}{V_{12}}$, where $V_{12}$ is the potential differene between the two conductors.
