## Part 1

Answer: B. This phenomen is related to [[Faraday's law of induction]], where the magnet will slow down as a consequence of an created magnetic force with the opposite direction.

Answer: E. B would have been correct if the light were bending away from the normal direction.

Answer: C. The size/polarity is uniquely defined as well.

Answer: B. For multi-coils: $\mathcal{V}(t) = - \frac{d \Lambda(t)}{dt} \Rightarrow \mathcal{V}(t) = -M \frac{I_{1}(t)}{dt}-MI_{0}\omega sin \omega t$

Answer: D. For three side, $\vec{D}$ is parallel to the surface, so zero from its integral for these sides. The remaining three parts representes 3 parts of a larger cube with double the side length (24 parts), this gives the net outward flux 3q/24 = q/8.

Answer: C. Can be seen as two electric dipoles placed in opposite direction to eachother.

Answer: A. Divide the problem into two semi-finite lengths straight wires and a 1/8 of a circle segment. From FC we can find the formula for a infinetely long straight wire. Also the formula for a loop (but for us 1/8). Add these together.

Answer: E. The [[Poynting vector]] is derived from the law of energy conservation, whilst the [[equation of continuity]] is based on the principle of conservation of electric charges. 

## Part 2

Here it is easiest to use vincents method in [[Resistance calculations]], as we know from the question what parameter that isn't constant. Using integral solution is also fine, since S is given. When calculating the double integral for J, do not use limits, use the given S as the area.

Draw the triangle and use geometry!
a) Due to symmetry $\vec{E}=0$.
b) $\Delta V$ is only for the final position, we can skip the infinity. Calculate the potential for one side and multiply by three. 
c) part a) doesn't change but b) does. instead we have $\varepsilon$.

a) Use [[Ampere's circuital law]], but where the right side becomes $\mu_{0}nLI$ instead. $nL$ because it's a coil. The amperian loop C is choosen as a part of the coil where L is the length of that part and n the windings of that part. 
b) [[magnetic circuits|magnetic circuit]]!!! Find the [[reluctance]] of the ferromagnetic core and air gaps. Find mmf by using ampere's, since it's equal to $NI$ and then the magnetic flux by using hopkins law. Then calculate for N > ....

We don't have to think about the oblique angle. Rewrite the incident wave to phasor form. Then find the reflecting wave (same as incident but $- \vec{a}_z$) and find its phasor form. For the reflecting wave we have a unknown quantity $E_{r0}$, this can be found by tangential component of [[boundary conditions for electrostatic fields]], since it's continous at z=0. Putting in z=0 into both fields we can find the quantit. Then calculate total electric field by adding them.
