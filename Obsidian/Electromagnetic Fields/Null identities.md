# Two Null Identities
Defined by using knowledge on [[Gradient]], [[divergence]] and [[Curl]].

## Null identity 1
Curl of the gradient of any [[scalar field]] is identically zero: $$\nabla \times (\nabla V) \equiv 0 $$
This is shown on p.61 in course book.
- This identity also implies that if a [[vector field]] $\vec{A}$ is curl-free ($\nabla \times \vec{A} = 0$), then it can be expressed as the [[gradient]] of a [[scalar field]] ($\vec{A} = \nabla V$)

## Null identity 2
The [[divergence]] of the [[curl]] of any [[vector field]] is identically zero: $$\nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \vec{A}) \equiv 0$$
Shown on p.62 in course book.
- This also implies that if a vector field $\vec{B}$ is divergenceless ($\nabla \cdot \vec{B}= 0$), then it can be expressed as the [[Curl]] of another [[vector field]] ($\vec{B} = \nabla \times \vec{A}$).
- We call this field solenoidal
