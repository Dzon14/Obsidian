# Electromagnetic Induciton
Static $\vec{B}$ field does not induce current, but **time-varying** $\vec{B}$ field does!

We can derive [[Faraday's law of induction]]:

and gives us $$\nabla \times \vec{E} = - \frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t}$$This is Faraday's law in **point form**. This is one of [[Maxwell's equations]].

-  [[Lenz' law]] - that an induced emf always give rise to a current whose magnetic field opposes the original change in magnetic flux $\equiv$ "Nature opposes a change in flux". Lenz' law helps determine the direction of current. 

- Once $\mathcal{V}$ is found, we can use [[magnetic circuits|magnetic circuit]] theory to find the current. 
- Time-varying flux in a closed path C ($\Rightarrow$ electromagnetic induction) can occur in several ways, as shown in the examples below)

## Example 1
Moving conductor in static uniform magnetic field. Find direction of current I.

## Example 2
- Moving circuit in a time-varying field

$\Rightarrow$ As long as the rate of change of flux can be obtained, it accounts for both moving circuit and time-varying $\vec{B}$.

**Note:** When finding inductance, we have already learned about calculating the [[magnetic flux]] of a closed circuit. Here, it is about finding the rate of change of flux (emf $\mathcal{V}$) and we can calculate the current $I$ in a circuit if given the resistance $R$.
