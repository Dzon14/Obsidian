# Steady Electric Current
- Charges (free) in motion that constitute current flow. 
- Current is constant, doesn't accelerate.
- Currents:
		- Conduction currents: caused by drift motion of conduction electrons
		- Electrolytic currents: result of migration of positive and negative ions
		- Convection currents: result from motion of electrons and/or ions in vacuum
- A loop with steady electric currents only produces static [[magnetic field]]s and do not influence the [[Electric field]].
