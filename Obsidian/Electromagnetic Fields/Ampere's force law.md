# Ampere's Force Law
$$\vec{F}_{21} = \frac{\mu_{0}I_{1}I_{2}}{4 \pi} \oint\limits_{C_{1}}^{} \oint\limits_{C_{2}}^{} \frac{d \vec{l}_{1} \times (d \vec{l}_{2} \times \vec{a}_{R_{21}})}{R_{21}^{2}} \ \ \ [N]$$
The law was validated by experiments on two long wires attracting/repelling each other depending on the directions of $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$.

Note the parallel between $\vec{F}_{21}$ and the electric force betweem two charges.
