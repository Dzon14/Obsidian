# Magnetic circuits
Magnetic circuits are not as prominent as electric circuits, but no less important. Some examples are transformers, generators, motors, relays and magnetic recording devices

Instead of voltage (electromotive force/emf) or current source, magnetic circuits rely on current loop (with N turns) as the source (wound around the core of a ferromagnetic material).
- [[magnetomotive force]] (mmf), $\mathcal{V}_{m}$ based on [[Ampere's circuital law]] is defined as $$\oint\limits_{C}^{} \vec{H} \cdot \ d \vec{l}=NI \overset{\Delta}{=} \mathcal{V}_{m} \ \ [A] \text{ or ampere-turns } [A.t]$$
For magnetic circuits, we assume:
- No leakage flux
- Linear magnetic materials

Find relationship between mmf and flux

## Example 1

current in a solenoid produces uniform $\vec{B}$ inside.

- [[reluctance]]
- [[Hopkinson's law]]

Analogous quanties: $$\begin{align} &\mathcal{V}_{m} \leftrightarrow V \\ &\mathcal{R} \leftrightarrow R \\ &\Phi \leftrightarrow I \end{align}$$

## Example 2

Grey box 1:  $$B_{f} = \frac{NI}{\left( \frac{l-l_{g}}{\mu}+\frac{l_{g}}{\mu_{0}} \right)}$$

Grey box 2: $$\Phi = \frac{NI}{\frac{l-l_{g}}{\mu S}+ \frac{l_{g}}{\mu_{0}S}}$$ where $S = a^{2}$.
