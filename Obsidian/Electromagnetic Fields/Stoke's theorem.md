# Stoke's theorem

## Definition
The surface integral of [[Curl]]$\vec{A}$ over an open surface S is equal to the circulation of $\vec{A}$ along C that bounds the surface
$$\int\limits_{S}^{} (\nabla \times \vec{A}) \ d \vec{s} = \oint\limits_{C}^{} \vec{A} \ d \vec{l}$$
## Illustration

Circulation of water 
non-zero only at sources (sinks).
Sum of circulation from all vortex sources since $\nabla \times \vec{A}$ is only non-zero at vortex sources.

## Why is Stoke's theorem important?
on of four of the [[Maxwell's equations]]
Where Amperes.... is defined using the [[Curl]].
Using the theorem we can write the "integral form" of Ampere's Circuital Law as: $$\int\limits_{S}^{} (\nabla \times) \cdot\vec{H} \ d \vec{s} = \oint\limits_{C}^{} \vec{H} \cdot \ d \vec{l} = I$$where $I$ is the total current enclose by C
