Answer: C. The concept of bounded charges is based on equivalent dipoles being formed. Has nothing to do with molecules gaining or losing atoms.

Answer: C. Calculate [[reluctance]] for center core and arms and add them. 

4.![[Pasted image 20230105142307.png]]
Answer: A. $\vec{E} = - \nabla V = \vec{E} = - \frac{dV}{dr}\vec{a}_{r} ...$

Answer: E. The net [[electric field]] inside the sphere and cavity is always zero, regardles if static or time-varying.

Answer: D. They are not independent. We need the linear properties as well.

Answer: E. The [[torque]] produced in a typical DC motor is the result of current flow in a closed circuit interacting with the [[magnetic field]] provided by permanent magnets to produce a magnetic force. The phenomenon is based on the concept of [[magnetic force]] experienced in a static magnetic field

Answer: A. The [[tangential component]] of the electric field $\vec{E}$ has a lower magnitude as the plane wave travels from medium 1 to medium 2. This is true since part of the plane wave is reflected due to the mismatch in the magnetic property (therefore different intrinsic impedances of the two materials)

## Part 2

a) Since $R >> d$ we can assume electric dipole and use correlating formula for $\vec{E}$. p = 2qd in this case.
b) The upper half is replaced by same equation but $\varepsilon$ instead of $\varepsilon_{0}$.
c) Does not change since [[steady electric currents]] produce only static magnetic field and does therefore not influence the electric field.

Draw its circuit diagram with two capacitors in parallel in series with the third. Use calculations for the parallel plate capacitor case. We want to find $C = \varepsilon \frac{S}{d}$ which is derived from tangential component and [[Gauss law]].

3.

Can be seen as magnetic dipole, use corresponding formula for magnetic field. m is the area times current (see formula sheet). the radius of C2 is $\frac{w}{2\pi}$.
a) We calculate mutual inductance for C2 to C1. Calculate $\Phi_{21}$ with the $\vec{B}$ we know multiplied with S which is the area of C1. Then calculate $M=L_{21}$.
b) Same expression for $L_{21}$ except $50\mu_{0}$ instead of $\mu$. The $\vec{B}$ field in the magnetic material is ennhanced by the alignment of the magnetic domains which increases the flux flowing through C1. 

4.

Electromagnetic field. The hard part here is to find S(t) (area of the loop) which is decreasing with time. $S(t) = 0.3-0.3 \cdot \text{ (length outside field) } =0.3(1-ut)$.  Then calculate magnetic flux and the emf.
