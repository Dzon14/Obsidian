# Electrostatics
- Mass of a proton = mass of a neutron $= 1,7 \cdot 10^{-26}$ kg
- Mass of an electron - $m_{e} = \frac{m_p}{1836}$
- Amber - elektron (electricity)

Some atoms are able to hold on to electrons more tightly than other atoms, hence more likely to gain electrons and become negatively charged, and vice versa. The electron-holding ability is ranked in “**triboelectric series**”.
- For ex: 
		  - Loose electrons - hair, oily skin, glass, silk ..
		  - small/no charge - paper, wool, wood
		  - Gain electrons - rubber, amber, gold, silver, plastic wrap etc
