# Polarization of Plane Waves 

When $\vec{E}$ oscillates in a fixed direction we call the [[plane waves in lossless media|plane wave]] linearly polarized in that direction. 
$E_{x} \rightarrow$ x-polarized field (oscillates along x).

## Same phase
When there are 2 plane waves with the same phase that oscillates in different directions, then the total $\vec{E}(z,t) = \vec{E}_{1}(z,t)+\vec{E}_{2}(z,t)$ oscillates in another fixed direction $\alpha$ (e.g. $\alpha= 45 \degree$).

$\Rightarrow \alpha = tan^{-1} \frac{E_{20}}{E_{10}}$
$\Rightarrow$ linearly polarized if same phase.

## Out of phase

The path of $\vec{E}(0,t)$ is an **ellipse** if $E_{10} \neq E_{20}$ and **circle** if $E_{10}= E_{20}$, due to which the plane waves are called elliptically and circurarly polarized, respectively.

$\Rightarrow$ thumb in direction of wave travel and finger in direction of rotation. 

- Right hand elliptically/circular polarization (anti-clockwise) and wave travel in positive z-direction.
- Left hand elliptically/circular polarization (clockwise) and wave travel in positive z direction.
