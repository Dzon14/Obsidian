We will continue our study of electric currents by relating its outward flow to the rate of change of volume charge density (Equation of Continuity), equivalent to Kirchhoff’s Circuit Law at the circuit level. Similarly, heat dissipation due to microscopic collisions in current flow can be derived as power density in point form, equivalent to Joule’s Law on the macroscopic level. Therefore, in this topic of steady electric currents, we can summarize the micro and macroscopic comparisons as:
