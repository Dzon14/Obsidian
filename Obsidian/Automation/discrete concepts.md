# Discrete control concepts

## The classical transfer line

Starving - no input product
Blocking - can not deliver finished product

## Introducing buffers

- Not always optimal with buffers since it requires a bigger production (needs more space)
	- hence, the size of the buffers are discussed, even though buffers are usual
## Parallel operations - machine center

-  More expensive machines
## Flexible manufacturing cell

Need **advanced** control computers to be fully utilized!
- Not very usual today. Other ways are better?

## Just-in-time (JIT) production
- Market demands flexibility
	- Fashion, seasons, trends, etc. 
- Large inventory
	- Costly, inflexible 
- Buffers hide production problems
	- Symptom of bad synchronization 
- Solution:
	- “produce necessary quantity at the right moment” $\Rightarrow$ JIT
**Goals of JIT:**
- Find and eliminate the losses and problems
- Simplify on all levels
- Material handling systems (e.g. Kanban)
	- Information technology
**Also:**
- No buffers
	- Pull system, meet customer demands 
- No waiting time
	- Remove the bottlenecks and set-up time 
- No errors (ISO 9XXX - Quality)
	- Quality control in all operations 
- No failures
	- Preventive maintenance 
- No paper
	- Administrative simplifications
- Smaller factories
- Meet fashion and trends (flexibility)
