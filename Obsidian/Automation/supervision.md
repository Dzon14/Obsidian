# Supervision
1. To observe the production or process in order to understand the current operational situation 
2. To act on the above obtained information to improve the process 
- Different types of information sources 
- Different methods to analyse the information

## Why supervision?
- Ensure product quality
	- does the product meet requirements?
- Ensure production safety
	- personnel, process, environment
- Efficient operation
	- time, economy

## System components
- Data collection
	- SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition)
- Manipulation
	- treatment, analysis, etc
- Visualisation
	- overview, status, values, trends

## Primary information sources
- Observations
	- process, equipment 
- Lab analyses
	- manual sampling and analysis 
- Binary information
	- status, alarms 
- Measurements
	- sensors, real-time measurements
## Secondary information sources
- Process descriptions
	- empirical, first principle models
- Estimations
	- states variables, parameters, pseudo variables
- Residuals
	- deviations from normal, prediction error

## Information extraction
- Data acquisition
	- sampling, collection and storage of data 
- Data rectification
	- screening and correction (replacement) of non- representative data 
- Detection
	- examination to detect abnormalities, faults or undesirable situations 
- Diagnosisâ€“ to find the cause of a fault or abnormality
