# Circular convolution
a type of [[Faltning|Convolution]].

When performing circular convolution of length N between two signals/sequences we also time-reverse one of them, shift it relative to the other one, and sum the product of individual elements for each shift, with the difference that we calculate indices mod N, and get a resulting sequence of length N.
