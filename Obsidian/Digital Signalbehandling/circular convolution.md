# Circular [[Faltning|convolution]]
a type of [[Faltning|Convolution]].

When performing circular [[Faltning|convolution]] of length N between two signals/sequences we also time-reverse one of them, shift it relative to the other one, and sum the product of individual elements for each shift, with the difference that we calculate indices mod N, and get a resulting sequence of length N.

## Matlab code (same example as before)
- Fast fourier transformation (FFT) command

## Circular $\longrightarrow$ linear [[Faltning|Convolution]]
Using the [[Discrete Fourier transform|DFT]] on a computer is a very efficient way of calculating the circular [[Faltning|convolution]].
Can we use DFT to calculate linear as well?
- One problem is that the result of the circular [[Faltning|convolution]] is of the same length as the sequence involved. However, linear conv. produces an output that is longer than the sequence.
- If we zero-pad two sequences and perform a circular [[Faltning|convolution]] we get:

- we get the same result as a linear [[Faltning|Convolution]]

## [[Faltning|linear convolution]] $\longrightarrow$ circular convolution
if we have an [[Linear and time-invariant (LTI) systems|LTI]] system with a linear convolution $$y(n) = h(n)*x(n) = \sum_{k=0}^{K-1}h(k)x(n-k)$$

This is used in communication systems. One of the most clever applications of the [[Discrete Fourier transform|DFT]].
