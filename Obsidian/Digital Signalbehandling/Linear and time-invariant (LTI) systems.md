# Linear and time-invariant (LTI) systems
- The impulse response h(n) of an LTI system is the output signal, when the input signal is a unit impulse at time n = 0.

- An arbitrary input signal x(n) can be written as a sum of delayde impulses
- Since LTI systems are both time-invariant and linear, the output signal y(n) will be the corresponding sum of impulse responses
