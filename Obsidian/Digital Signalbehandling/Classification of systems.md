# Classification of systems
A system
- without memory is called static
- with memory is called dynamic
- whose input-output characteristics does not change with time is called time-invariant
- whose input-output characteristics change with time is called time - variant
- that satisfies the superposition principle is a linear system
- that does not satisfy the superposition principle is a non-linear system.
- where the output at any time only depends on the current and past inputs is called casual
- for which bounded inputs $(\lvert x(n) \rvert \leq M_{x})$ always produce bounded outputs $(\lvert y(n) \rvert \leq M_{y})$ is called bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable.
