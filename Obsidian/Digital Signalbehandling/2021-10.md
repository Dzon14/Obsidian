a) The propeller looks as it has stopped if it has rotated an integer multiple of a quarter revolution between samples. It samples at 50 Hz $\Rightarrow$ $\frac{1}{50}$s. We also have a Propeller Rotational Frequencey (rotation/seconds) $F_{r}$. we get $$\frac{F_{r}}{50} = \frac{k}{4}$$The lowest non-zero rotational frequency at which the propeller looks to stand still is when $k=1$ which gives $F_{r} = 12.5 \ Hz$. This is $60 \cdot 12.5 = 750 \ RPM$. (RPM is 60seconds/minute)
b)

(You get folded signals by taking 1/2 - the frequency).

a) $h(n) = h_{1}(n) * (h_{2}(n)-h_{3}(n) * h_{4}(n))$

I don't fully understand this. Look at Benjamin's way (photo in chat), he Z-transforms each $h(n)$ beforehand, then do the operations and inverse at the end.

- First z-transform and find $H(z)$ with poles and zeros. x(n) has two components, where the first one ($x_{1}(n)$) has a transform according to FC. Multiply it with $H(z)$ to find $Y_{1}(z)$, here [[partialbråksuppdelning|partial-fraction expansion]] is needed. Then inverse transform it to $y_{1}(n)$.
- To find $y_{2}(n)$: ![[Pasted image 20230407114254.png]]

a) Look at denominator and compare to transformations (21 & 22). See solution. 
b) We have the poles from a). $z = \alpha e^{\pm j \beta}$ (two conjugate)

The causal LTI system is BIBO stable (all poles inside the unit circle),
