a)-d) standäd
e) Overlap-add! Downside: x(n) is processed in blocks and we need to collect a number of samples before starting to process them. This leads to a *delay* increasing with the used block length, which we do not want in real-time processing

Transform both sequences, multiple them and then inverse transform. 
After multiplying them [[partialbråksuppdelning|partial-fraction expansion]] is needed (look platta).
- Remember to re-write $x_{1}$ into $\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}u(n-1)$.

a) Use FC. System order is two. Rewrite into a diff eq.
b) Z-transform the diff.eq and find $H(z)$. Find the zeros and poles and draw diagram...
c) Split it into two different $x(n)$ and find $H(z) \cdot X(z)$ for both. For the left term we will have to use z-transform pairs 21 & 22 (see platta) to find $H(z)$ and then multiply with X, then inverse transform to get $y(n)$. For the right term we know that $y(n) = \lvert H(\omega) \rvert_{\omega} \cdot sin(\omega n + \angle H(\omega))$. Finally add them together.

By putting in $\omega = 0$ we get 1 $\Rightarrow$ doesn't affect the the amplitude.
c) Calculate the quadratic abs value (here we need to rewrite a bit, see platta). Set it equal to $\frac{1}{2}$ and find $\omega_{3dB}$.

(obs, wrong in solution, should be $H_{1}$ here)
