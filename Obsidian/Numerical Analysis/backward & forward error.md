# Backward/Forward error

![[Pasted image 20230322163629.png]]
There exists a general relationship between relative forward error and relative backward error.

**Residual:** In mathematics, residual refers to the difference between the actual value of a dependent variable and the predicted value of that variable based on a given model or equation.

**Forward error**:
imagine input $\rightarrow$ output (through a "box")

## Relation between forward and backward error
For this relation we need [[perturbation analysis]]
