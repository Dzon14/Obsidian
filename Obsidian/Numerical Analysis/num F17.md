# Numerical Analysis F17 - Eigenvalues & FFT 
In this, last, lecture we say a few words about methods for finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues of square matrices and about methods for computing the discrete Fourier transform of periodic functions

## Topics
- [[power iteration]]


## Finding eigenpars numerical
