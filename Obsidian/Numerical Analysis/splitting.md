# Splitting
In numerical analysis, splitting refers to the process of breaking down a complex problem into simpler sub-problems that can be solved more easily. This approach is often used to solve linear equations, where the original problem can be decomposed into smaller problems that can be solved iteratively. Splitting can help reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements of a problem, making it more feasible to solve. There are different methods for splitting, such as Jacobi splitting, Gauss-Seidel splitting, and successive over-relaxation (SOR) splitting.
- Summarized, it is used for both [[Jacobi method]] and [[Gauss-Seidel method]].
