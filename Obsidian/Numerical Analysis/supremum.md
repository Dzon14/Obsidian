# Supremum
Den minsta övre begränsningen som en mängd M har. 
In words, the supremum of a set is the smallest number that is greater than or equal to every element in that set.

1.  sup(A) must be an upper bound of A, which means that sup(A) is greater than or equal to every element in A.
2.  sup(A) must be the smallest upper bound of A, which means that if there is any other number y that is an upper bound of A, then y must be greater than or equal to sup(A).
