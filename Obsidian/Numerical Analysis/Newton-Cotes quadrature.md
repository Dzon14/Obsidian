# Newton-Cotes quadrature
Newton-Cotes quadrature is a family of numerical integration methods for approximating the definite integral of a function. These methods use equally spaced nodes and weights to construct a polynomial approximation of the integrand, which is then integrated exactly. The most basic Newton-Cotes method is the trapezoidal rule, which approximates the area under the curve by a trapezoid with the endpoints of the interval as the vertices. Other methods in the Newton-Cotes family include the midpoint rule, Simpson's rule, and the extended midpoint rule. These methods can be used for both closed and open intervals, and can be extended to higher dimensions for multiple integrals.
