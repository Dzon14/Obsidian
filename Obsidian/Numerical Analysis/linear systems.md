# Linear systems

The linear system $Ax = b$ has a unique solution $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ , if the following properties holds:
1. A is invertible (regular, non-singular)
2. $det(A) \neq 0$
3. $rank(A) = n$ , A has full rank
4. The unique solution of $Ax = 0$ is $x=0$
If $A \in \mathbb{R}^{nxn}$ is singular the system $Ax=b$ has either *infinity many*solutions or *no sloution* at all.
