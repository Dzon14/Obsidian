# Piecewise polynomial interpolation
- A method of approximating a function by using different polynomial equations in different intervals of its domian. By dividing it into several intervals - [[partition]] - and then approximating the function using a polynomial equation within each subinterval. 
The combined function will then be defined *piecewise*

Types:
- [[cubic spline interpolation]]
- [[spline]]
