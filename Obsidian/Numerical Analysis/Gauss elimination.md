# Gauss elimination
Two [[linear systems]] are *equivalent* if and only if they have the same solution set.
The following operations give an equivalent system:
- Interchange
- Scaling
- Replacement

- Solve by using [[back substitution]]

## [[pivoting]]

## Operation count of Gauss...
$$\frac{2}{3}n^{3} + \frac{3}{2}n^{2} - \frac{7}{6} n$$
