# Bracketing method
- A root-finding method used to locate e root of a function within a given interval. The method works by identifying two points within the interval such that the function has opposite signs at these points. By repeatedly narrowing the interval containing the root using this property, the method converges to the root.

1. Begin with an interval (i.e 2 initial approximations) in which the root lays.
2. Iteratively reduce the width of this interval (bracket) systematically
3. Stop, if the root is reached to a desired accuracy.

## Commonly used bracketing method
- Bisection method
- Regular Falsi (or method of false position)
