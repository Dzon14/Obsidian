# Kirchhoff's Current Law
For n interconnected conducting wires $$\oint\limits_{S}^{}  \vec{J} \cdot \ d \vec{s} \Rightarrow \sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}I_{j} = 0$$which is [[Kirchhoff's current law]], which states that the algebraic sum of all currents flowing out of a junction in an electric circuit is zero.

Where all currents (integral of each $\vec{J}$) is 0.
