# Ohm's Law 
For metals, with each charge carrier (electron) having the charge $q = -e \ \ [C]$, we can write: $$\vec{J} = Nq \vec{u} = -Ne \vec{u}$$where $-Ne \overset{\Delta}{=} \rho_{e}$ and $\rho_{e} \equiv \text{electron charge density} \ \ [Cm^{-3}]$

To relate the current density to the applied $\vec{E}$ field, we substitute from $\vec{u} = - \mu_{e}\vec{E}$, i.e.: $$\vec{J} = \rho_{e}\mu_{e}\vec{E} = \sigma \vec{E} \ \ [Am^{-2}]$$ where the proportionality constant is defined as conductivity $\sigma = -\rho_{e} \mu_{e} \ \ [A/Vm or S/m]$ 
$\Rightarrow \text{The expression } \vec{J} = \sigma \vec{E}$ is [[Ohm's law in point form]], defined for any point in the metal.
Isotropic materials (i.e. $\sigma$ not depending on direction of $\vec{E}$) where Ohm's law (in point form) is satisfied is called **ohmic materials**

$$R = \frac{\mathcal{l}}{\sigma S}$$
