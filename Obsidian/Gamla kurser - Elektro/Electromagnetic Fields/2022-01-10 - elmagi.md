Answer. E. if $S=0.1 \Rightarrow R = \frac{100 \mathcal{l}}{\sigma S} \Rightarrow 100R$.

Answer: C. The force will be different for several reasons, including the conductivity of the material influencing the size of the induced eddy currents and the ferromagnetic property of the iron (as compared to the weakly paramagnetic aluminum) enhancing the field produced by the coil. The student does not need to know the precise properties to answer this question. It is enough to know that these metals exhibit different properties that can influence the resulting force.

Answer: B. This is wrong because electric current is due to free electrons all around the circuit (including the filament and cable) starting to drift due to the imposed electric field. (C) is related to the basic resistance equation â€“ length and cross section area are critical to provide higher resistance. (E) LED does not rely on heat-generating mechanism to produce light.

## Part 2
1.
![[Pasted image 20230107154744.png]]
change the second wave to sin. 
a) Different phases $\Rightarrow$ not linear. Different amplitudes $\Rightarrow$ Elliptical polarized. Positive z-direction, left hand
b) Use "Truls" method. $\vec{a}_{E} = (\vec{a}_{x}-\vec{a}_{y})$

Draw schematic and find out what resistances are parallel and in series. Then calculate [[reluctance]] for each resistance. One for the core and one for the arms (since arms have the same). length is calculated from the middle of the bar.

[[method of images]]!
calculate length to each image charge and then the length to the point where the charges get moved (double the normal length). Then calculate three different works, from each image charge to the real charge. (3 image charges each inducing electric force on the real charge). Calculate using $W_{1}= - \int\limits_{}^{} \vec{F} \cdot \ d \vec{l} = - q \int\limits_{}^{} \vec{E} \ d \vec{l}$
b) Will not change. We get the sama attractive force and repulsive force.

[[Gauss law]].
Calculate $\rho$ for the electron cloud and then find Q for the whole space (using that $\rho$. Then calculate LHS of Gauss = RHS of that Q and get $R_{0}$.
