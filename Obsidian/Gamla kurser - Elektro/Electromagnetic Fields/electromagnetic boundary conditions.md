# Electromagnetic Boundary Conditions

## Task 1: Normal component
The same boundary conditions for the normal components of $\vec{D}$ and $\vec{B}$. Meaning that it is the same as [[boundary conditions for electrostatic fields]] and [[boundary conditions for static magnetic fields]] for the *normal component*.

## Task 2: Tangential component
Two of [[Maxwell's equations]] can be used to derive the boundary conditions for the tangential components of $\vec{E}$ and $\vec{H}$, but they are different from their static counterparts. 

However, if we follow similar steps of taking a closed loop across the boundary to derive boundary conditions, the time-varying quantities $\frac{d \Phi}{dt} = \int\limits_{S}^{} \frac{\partial \vec{B}}{\partial t} \cdot \ d \vec{s}$ and $\int\limits_{S}^{} \frac{\partial \vec{D}}{\partial t} \cdot \ d \vec{s}$ that represent rate of change of electric and [[magnetic flux]] on the surface S (enclosed by C), respectively, will approach zero as $\Delta \rightarrow 0$ (the surface area S of the loop C vanishes). This means that 
$\Rightarrow$ The boundary conditions for the static fields will also be valid for the *tangential components*.
