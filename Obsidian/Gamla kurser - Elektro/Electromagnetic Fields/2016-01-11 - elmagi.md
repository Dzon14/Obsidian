## Part 1

Answer: C. It will be $V = 0$ (think image charge), however since they have opposite signs they will be added to eachother instead of minus. Therefore multiply point charge equation with 2.

Answer: D. The vertical slots will hinder the flow of eddy currents around the cylindrical pipe. By Lenzâ€™ Law, the falling permanent magnet creates the eddy currents in the original pipe that result in a magnet field that opposes the change in the magnetic field of the falling magnet.

Answer: E. I is false since the local surface charge density is proportional to the normal component of the electric field, not the potential on the surface. II is false since the dipole will experience a downward (attractive) force for both positive and negative charges and no net torque will result (weaker repulsive force between the charge and its similar-signed image charge). III is false since $\vec{D} = \varepsilon \vec{E}$ is only valid for linear material

Answer: D. Not same phase and different amplitude.

Answer: C. $C = \varepsilon \frac{S}{d}$. ![[Pasted image 20230108100213.png]]

Answer: A. Surface charge is 0 between two dielectrics $\Rightarrow$ Continous.

Answer: B. not E because it should be [[vector field]]. Option (D) is false, since even though an appropriate choice of the coordinate system can simplify the solution of a problem (e.g., using cylindrical coordinates to solve for the electric field of a charged cylinder), it is not impossible to use other coordinate systems to solve the same problem.
