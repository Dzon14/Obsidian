# Spherical coordinates
$$(u_{1}, u_{2}, u_{3}) = (R, \theta , \phi)$$
An intersection of three surfaces: 
- A spherical surface centered at the origin with a radius $R = R_{1}$ 
- A right circular cone with its apex at the origin, having a half-angle $\theta = \theta_{1}$
- A half-plane containing the z-axis and making an angle $\phi= \phi_{1}$ with the xz-plane.

- All previous derivations (orthogonal) apply here as well.

The differential length: 
$d \mathcal{l} = a_{R}dR + a_{\theta}Rd \theta + a_{\phi}Rsin \theta d \phi$

Expressions for other differentials: $$\begin{align} ds_{R}= R^{2} sin \theta \ d \theta d \phi \\ ds_{\theta} = Rsin \theta \ dR d \phi \\ ds_{\phi}= R \ dR d \theta \end{align}$$
