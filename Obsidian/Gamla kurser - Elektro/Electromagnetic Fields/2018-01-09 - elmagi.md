## Part 1

Answer: A. The [[magnetic flux]] is derived from experimental observation, but [[vector magnetic potential]] is derived based on theory.

B. Calculate magnetic dipole moment for all choices. $m = IS$. For B: $m = I \pi \left( \frac{4l}{2 \pi} \right)^{2} = \frac{Il^{2}4}{\pi} \approx 1.3 Il^{2}$.

Answer: E. Has nothing to do with that.

Answer: E. All are wrong. 3 is wrong because it's only valid in the region of the real charge (not beyond the boundary replaced by image charges).

Answer: B. The charges placed on different conductors interact one another to result in different [[Electric potential]]s on the conductors.

Answer: C. . Each of the cavity with a point charge contributes to an equivalent point charge at the center of the sphere. However, since the two charges are equal and opposite in polarity, the resulting E field is zero at any point outside of the sphere.

Answer: E. Using [[Gauss law]] the total electric flux leaving the point charge is $\frac{q}{\varepsilon_{0}}$. If the point charge is at the center of the cube, then by symmetry, the electric flux leaving one side is $\frac{q}{6 \varepsilon_{0}}$. In this case, the point charge is off centered, but it can be seen to be located at the center of a larger cube of dimensions 4a × 4a × 4a, in which case the grey surface represents only one quarter of one side. Using symmetry, the electric flux leaving the grey surface is one quarter of the electric flux leaving on side of the larger cube, which is also $\frac{6}{6 \varepsilon_{0}}$. Hence, the answer is $\frac{q}{4 \cdot 6 \varepsilon_{0}}$.

## Part 2

a) Write it in cartesian coordinates. , rewrite cos to sin and then write in cartesian coord. using given $\vec{k}$ and position vector $\vec{R}$.
Since same phase, it's linearly polarized (negative x-axis)
b) Solved throught "Truls" method, since it's the easiest. Using $\vec{a}_{k}=\vec{a}_{E} \times \vec{a}_{H}$.
c) Pretty straight forward. Directions is found through right-hand rule (fingers being vectors).

Can be solved in 2 ways. Either using the relationship between [[current densities]] and [[Electric field]] or through [[Resistance calculations]], where the latter is easiest if comfortable with geometry. The first method is based on finding $\vec{J}$, then finding $\vec{E}$ through the relationship, then integrating to find potential V and rearranging to get $\sigma$.

For this problem we assume magnetic dipole for $C_{1}$ and for $C_{2}$ (here we can also use magnetic flux density for circular wire loop, but not for $C_{1}$ since it's flat to the point). When using the magnetic dipole, the calculation needs to be in cartesian coordinates.

A "typical" [[Gauss law]] problem. Find LHS and RHS to get the electric field. Then find the charge and potential throught relationship of $\vec{E}=- \nabla V$.
