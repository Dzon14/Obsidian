## Part 1 - multiple choice questions
1.

Answer: B - II only. Electromagnets can also be formed using DC (static $\vec{B}$ field). TIme-varying field may not be needed at a steady state operation.

2.

Answer: E. Would've been B if the flat sheet was in the $x=0$ plane. The E-field is constant for B, pointing outwards from the x=0 plane. For $x>0$ the direction is $\vec{a}_{x}$ (if positive).

Answer: D. The medium above is mirrored as well.

4.

Answer: C. From the wavenumber $k= \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}= b \Rightarrow \lambda= \frac{2\pi}{b}$ .

5.

Answer: B. Capacitance is not dependent on electric charges. 

6.

Answer: E. $\vec{H}$ does not depend on the permeability of the material. (Based om [[Ampere's circuital law]])

Answer: D. See [[Elmagi F11]]

8.

Answer: A. According to definition of [[boundary conditions for electrostatic fields]] (normal component). Note: incidence at an oblique angle is not in the lecture, but can be found in course book.

## Part 2 - Calculation questions
1. ![[Pasted image 20230103134911.png]]
**USE** [[method of images]]. 
a) Remember that force is given by $\vec{F} = q \vec{E}$. Use [[Coulomb's law]] for discrete number of charges (three of them, not Q). Then solve for Q. 
b) Yes. Q doesn't depend on the permittivity. 

2.

I found this problem hard. 
a) Based on en example in [[Elmagi F12]]. Use [[Biot-Savart law]] and find $d \vec{l}' \times \vec{a}_{r}$ throught geometry. Cylindrical coordinates. Since it's not a closed circuit, we cannot use [[Ampere's circuital law]]. 
b) Use $\vec{B}$ from a). Find [[magnetic flux]] and then use calculations for mutual [[inductance]].

3.

We can see this as two resistances in parallel. Calculate the resistance as if the whole gap would be $\sigma_{1}$, then calculate the resistance for $\sigma_{2}$ and add them in parallel. $\mathcal{R} = \frac{\mathcal{l}}{\sigma S}$. The surface area is $4 \pi R^{2}$.

4.

Very difficult. 
cos comes from dot product definition.
Find [[magnetic flux]] and then use induced emf formula.
