# Behavior of Magnetic Materials
In electrostatics, we classified materials into conductors, semi-conductors and insulators (dielectrics), according to the amount of free electrons available in these materials (high, low and none, respectively). In magnetostatics, we classify materials by their reaction to static magnetic fields into three categories: **Diamagnetic**, **paramagnetic** and **ferromagnetic**.

## Diamagnetic material
The spinning and orbital motions of all electrons are randomly oriented in the absence of an external magnetic field, which means there is no net magnetic field. When an external field is introduced, the electrons experience a magnetic force $\vec{F}_{m}=q \vec{u} \times \vec{B}$ , causing the angular velocities to vary. By Lenz' law of electromagnetic induction (details to be given in Lecture 17), the induced magnetic field (with steady velocity/current at equilibrium) always oppose the applied external field, which reduces the net magnetic flux density $\vec{B}$.

## Paramagnetic material
The spinning and orbital motions of all electrons are oriented in such a way that there is a net magnetic field. This allows the atoms and molecules of these materials to align themselves to the applied external magnetic field (like a compass needle aligning to the Earth's magnetic field). This alignment increases the net magnetic flux density $\vec{B}$. However, thermal vibrations limit the alignment (hence temperature dependent). As for diamagnetism, this impact on the external field is mostly weak.

## Ferromagnetic materials
(cobalt, nickel, iron etc)
It acts to increase the net magnetic flux density $\vec{B}$, as in paramagnetic materials, but the effect is orders of magnitude stronger! Ferromagnetism can be explained in terms of "magnetized domains" (see figure). These are regions (in the order of $\mu$m to mm) in a ferromagnetic material with aligned magnetic dipoles (from spinning electrons), separated by domain walls. In the absence of external magnetic field, there is no net magnetic field.

The schematic below shows that when an external field $\vec{B}$ is applied, the domain walls move to enlarge the domains that are magnetized in the direction of the external field.

When the external $\vec{B}$ field exceeds a certain level, the movements of the domain walls are not reversible (alignment by domain rotation may also occur), resulting in the material being magnetized even when the external field is removed (i.e. a permanent magnet). Further increase of the applied field will eventually cause a saturation of the net $\vec{B}$ field.
