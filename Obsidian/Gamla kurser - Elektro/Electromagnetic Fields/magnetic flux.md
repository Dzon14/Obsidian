# Magnetic flux
$$\vec{B} = \nabla \times \vec{A} \Rightarrow\Phi = \int\limits_{S}^{} \vec{B} \cdot \ d \vec{s} \ \ [Wb]$$
$\Rightarrow$ Total outward flux passing through surface S

By using [[Stoke's theorem]] we can relate it to $\vec{A}$([[vector magnetic potential]])

Physical interpretation: Circulation of A around C equals the total magnetic flux passing through the surface enclosed by the flux.
