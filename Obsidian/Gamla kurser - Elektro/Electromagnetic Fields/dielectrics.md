# Dielectrics
Dielectrics have no free electrons, only bounded ones. Since they contain charges they might affect the [[Electric field]] in which they are placed. Even though the molecules may be macroscopically neutral, an [[Electric field]] will cause a force to be exerted on each charged particle and results in small displacements of positive and negative charges in opposite directions. These displacements are small in comparison to atomic dimensions, but nevertheless [[Polarisering|polarize]] a dielectric material and creates electric dipoles.
