# Technology Road Mapping (TRM)
- A high-level, visual plan that communicates an organization's technology strategy.
- Why, What, How, When
## Roots and forgotten history
- TRM recognized and a established management tool
- It's a history and development: Key mile stones
- Academic research has lagged well behind the industry practice
- Well integrated in industrial engineerng
- Six companies in the forefront (choice)
- Motorla, BP, Philips, EIRMA, Lucent technologies and SIA (Semiconductor)
- Powerful and popular tech management "tool/method"
- Unique differentiating feature  = Structural visual representation(s)
		  - Supported with the Questions: Why-What-How-When
  - Enable dialog and consensus building (process involving a good-faith effort to meet the interest of all stakeholders and seek a unanimous agreement)
  - Stakeholders: Supporst ongoing syncronization among and across the relevant stakeholders
  - Action tool based on relevant and rigor tech insights
		  - The practice of TRM is much older that academic

## Barriers to implement agile TRM
![[Pasted image 20230920145905.png]]

- Reactive management style â€“ the organization struggled to provide technology assets in time to satisfy its product roadmaps 
- Identify and maintain knowledge regarding the internal and external technology readiness 
- No assessments of gaps between current capability and product requirements 
- Strategies for systematically mapping, quantifying and prediction of of long-term tech development to leverage investments in R&D

## Technology Maps

#####  1. Technology Identification

##### 2. Decide on Technology Additions

##### 3. Decide on "What to Sell" Strategy
- Critical issue: marketing risk
- Continuum of options

##### 4. Ongoing Management
Actively manage technology asset base
- **Modularity**: 
		  - Building a complex product from smaller subsystems that can be designed independently, and function together as a whole
		  - Requires architect company to have deep product knowledge for advance specification of subsystems
		  - Reduces uncertainty in product design
-  **Product platforms**:
		  - A common architecture based on a single design
		  - Next-generation produts: new product platforms
				  - requires significant investments
				  - enhanced performance benefits
				  - Example: Each generation of Intel's processor chips
- **Derivative Products**: 
		- Include different models, brands, or versions of the platform product
		- Intended to fill performance gaps between platform products
		- Example: slower/faster chip versions introduced within months of the new chip
- Intellectual property management

Why use a platform and derivative strategy?
1. Unit-one cost
		- the cost of producing the first unit is very high relative to reproduction
2. "Gaps" in the marketplace
		- Holes in the customer migration from old to new technology
