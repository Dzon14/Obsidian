## Technology Adoption Life Cycle Model
##### "Crossing the Chasm"
![[Pasted image 20230918160208.png|450]]

## The Chasm
- Present in high-tech environments 
- Gap between early market and mainstream market— 
		- Visionaries vs. Pragmatists 
	- Visionary market is saturated, and mainstream not yet ready to buy 
	- Marketing that was successful with visionaries simply is not effective with pragmatists

## Crossing the Chasm

#### 1. Identify a beachhead: 
a single target market from which to pursue the mainstream market. 
A good beachhead: 
a) Gives customers a compelling reason to buy based on the firm’s capabilities 
b) Provides “adjacencies” to enter related segments 
- Bowling Alley Market Development:

1. Word of mouth relationship should exist between adjacent market segments 
2. Quickly capture the beachhead 
3. Risks: Focus on one segment could lead to being outflanked by competitors 
- Pursuing too many segments at outset without enough resources

#### 2. Develop the whole product
- Complete, end-to-end solution
- Defined within confines of a specific target market 
Adjacencies are also determined by similarities in whole product needs. Pragmatist market requires vendor responsibility for system integration.
- Utilizing partnerships
- Advantages:
		  - Each player provides a part of the whole product solution
		  - Partners may drive further expansion
