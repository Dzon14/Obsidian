# Teknologistrategier i nätverk

Tre dynamiska processer
- Anskaffa (explore)
- Leda (Manage)
- Skapa värde (exploit)

- Tre teknologiska resurser: Produkt, process och marknad
- Beslutsprocesser på olika nivåer

## Management Challenges
- Managers have difficulty with understanding and codify their technologies; internal and external 
- No coherent approach: Acqusition (explore), management and exploitation 
- Normative models (often) 
- Challenge: Develop critical thinking

## Management Challenges B
1. Combining technological resources
2. ..that comes from variety of sources
3. Technological resources that are owned or controlled by other actors. How to understand and access these?

## Management Challenges C
- Not only configure (managing) "our own" technologies... but also identify relationships ("often iterative") in the "eco-system"
- Technologies of others stakeholders: often independent (with other goals)

## Technology knowledge
- The ability of a firm to compete in its chosen product market is underpinned (supported) by the range of technological knowledge that it controls

## CTS - Company Technological System & Network Position
- CTS = Three "revised" processes: Products, Processes and Company Technology base (Market still important)
- The CTS links the components of the network position (the specific relationsships with other companies) to the companys internal processes for acquire, managing and exploiting technologies

## Network position
- The company´s ability to fulfill its present role is based on the particular combination of internal and external technologies to address the particular requirements of different applications and actions of other actors.
- The key factor in TS for the company is to understand deeply the relative importance and location of the range of technologies, both internal and external, that is must employ (use) to meet the requirements of others. 
- The strategic task for each company is to manage its bundles of resources and relationships in order to maintain is own position.

## Eco system (example)

## Technology strategies in networks
- Show companies how to manage their technology to support its value creation
- Company Technological System (CTS)
- Acquire and gaining access to technology of other actors in networks.
- Combining technological resources/competence

## A process of managing technologies
- ”Framework of decisions about technology on all ”levels”– and ..a view of industrial networks, in which - company behaviour - is powerful mediated by the external context in which its embedded”

## Contribution A
- 1)Dynamic lead and managed 
- Aquire/Managing/Exploiting 
- 2) Context: Understanding the whole 
- network/Combining techologies 
- 3) Power: Owned and controlled by 
- others
## Contribution B
- Not only configurations of its own technologies, but relations with and linkages within the chosen system/”eco-system”. 
- Linkages; CTS (system), TS-strategy, Business strategies and network/partners 
- Suppliers and customers key roll (exchanges, information, partnership) 
- Collaboration with university research (example Vinnova Sweden
