# LTI systems as filters
- A [[filter]] is something that discriminates between different components of an input and treat them differently. 
- LTI systems are often referred to as fulters since they influence differente freq. components.

Pole at $\omega = 0$ and zero at $\omega = +- \pi$ makes a LP filter
if u mirror it u make a HP filter.

- Zeros close to, or on, the unit circle reduces the magnitude of H(ω), when z = e jω is close to the zero 
- Poles close to, or on, the unit circle increases the magnitude of H(ω), when z = e jω is close to the pole 
- Since poles and zeros have the opposite effect, they can cancel each others influence, entirely if in same location, and “almost” if they are relatively close

- The one closest to the unit circle will **dominate**!
