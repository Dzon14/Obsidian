# Nyquist sampling theorem 
A bandlimited continous-time signal, with highest frequency (bandwith) B, can be uniquely recovered from its samples, provided that the sampling rate $f_{s} \geq 2B$ samples per second (**Nyquist rate**).

$$F_{S}= \frac{1}{T_{S}} \geq 2F_{max}$$
$\frac{F_{S}}{2}$ is the [[Nyquistfrekvensen|nyquist frequency]] and $2F_{max}$ is the Nyquist rate
