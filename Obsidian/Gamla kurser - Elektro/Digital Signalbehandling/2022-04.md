e) Linear convolution gives a result of duration $K+L-1$, and the entire convolution sequence must fit in the N-points of the results $\Rightarrow N \geq K+L-1$. This is to avoid aliasing in the time domain.

- We have zeros $z_{1,2}=re^{\pm j \theta}$ . Since it's a FIR filter with Linear phase, there will be mirrored zeros (reciprocal) $\Rightarrow \frac{1}{r}...$
- $H_{2}(z)$ will therefore be same as $H_{1}(z)$ but with $\frac{1}{r}$ instead AND a constant C which determines the amplification of the filter. 
- To find C we need to make constant signals $w=0 \Rightarrow z=1$, meaning we multiply the cascade with eachother for $z=1$ and set it equal to 1. We can then find C.

a) Since we have no DC signals, zero is set at $z=1$. For it to be a HP filter, we place the pole at negative 0.9.
b) Just write out the equation using zero and pole, then multiply with a factor C. Remember to rewrite it to $z^{-1}$ form. 
c) Insert $z=e^{j \omega}$ into $H$. Use Euler's formula:

d) Insert $\pi$ into equation above, we get $\lvert C \rvert \frac{2}{0.1}$, C can be either positive or negative but we choose $C= \frac{1}{20}$. Put it in in the equation in b)
e) Write out the diff.eq. and inverse transform and factorize out $y(n)$.

**In general**: All these problems require you to find the angle for the poles and zeros and then write it as frequency. By looking at the frequency on the magnitude and phase diagrams we can find out which one it is by thinking about the properties of zeros and poles.
*Properties:*
- Zeros will attenuate near unit circle where magnitude gets 0 if it's on the unit circle. (The frequence calculated for zeros will be the lowest point in magnitude) The phase however will increase for a zero where if it's on the unit circle it will be a positive phase jump. 
- Poles will amplify near and be at peak at its closest (or if it's on the unit circle). The phase will decrease (a negative slope), with higher change the close it is to the unit circle.

a) Look at formula collection, since it's Direct form II. Either look at $H(z)$ directly or $y(n)$, then z-transform.
b) Multiply them together and write it as a diff.eq. Then inverse z-transform and find $y(n)$ to realize it as DII. 
c) Z-transform $x(n)$, then  calculate $Y(Z) = H(Z)X(Z)$ and inverse transform.
