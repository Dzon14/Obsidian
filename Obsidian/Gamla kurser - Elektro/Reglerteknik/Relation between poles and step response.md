# Relation between poles and step response

## [[value theorem]]

## Stability and behaviour

Factorise the denominator of the transfer function, find the poles. Plot poles in the s-plane. The pole will affect the time-plane behaviour. 
Stable if left side of the s-plane.

- Stable if $\zeta > 0$
- Unstable if $\zeta < 0$
- Marginable stable if $\zeta = 0$
