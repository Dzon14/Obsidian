# Default Gateway
A default gateway, also known as a default route, is a network node that acts as an access point for traffic from devices on one network to another network. It serves as the destination for all network traffic that is not destined for a specific address on the local network, and it forwards that traffic to the appropriate network. The default gateway is typically a router or switch that connects the local network to the internet or another network. It allows devices on the local network to communicate with devices on other networks by providing a route for the traffic to follow.
