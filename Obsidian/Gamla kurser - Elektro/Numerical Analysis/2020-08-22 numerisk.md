Note the "new" way of writing out the matrix (from lecture)

a)  Composite midpoint rule. It approximates the integral $\int\limits_{0}^{2} e^{-x^{2}} \ dx$
b) Global error $\mathcal{O}(h^{2})$ decreases to $\frac{1}{h^{2}}$ as $N$ tends to infinity.

a) Either implicit trapezoid method or the implicit midpoint method since they both are second-order methods.
NOTE: I did not think correctly whilst doing this. The $y(0.2)$ indicates that we should iterate two times since h=0.1, that's why I didn't get teh right answer at first .... Also i have $u_{i}$ in LHS instead of $u_{i+1}$ which flips the fraction.
