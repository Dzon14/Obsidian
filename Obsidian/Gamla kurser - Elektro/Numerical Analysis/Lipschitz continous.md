# Lipschitz continous
- Used in [[fixed-point iteration]]
- A function f(x) is said to be Lipschitz continuous if there exists a constant K such that for any two points x1 and x2 in the domain of f, the absolute value of the difference between the values of f at those points is no greater than K multiplied by the absolute value of the difference between x1 and x2. In other words, the function f is said to be Lipschitz continuous if there is a bound on the ratio of the change in the function value to the change in the argument over the entire domain of the function

(This is only valid in one dimension)
- This always comes in exam - to check if it's contraction or not!!!!
