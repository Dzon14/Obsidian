# Banach's fixed-point theorem
Banach's fixed point theorem is a fundamental result in mathematics that establishes the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point of a function under certain conditions. More specifically, the theorem states that if a function defined on a complete metric space satisfies a contraction condition, meaning that it contracts the distance between any two points in the space, then it has a unique fixed point in that space.
