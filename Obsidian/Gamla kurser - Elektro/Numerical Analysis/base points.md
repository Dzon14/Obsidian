# Base points
With the standard form of a polynomial being $$c_{1}+ c_{2}x+ c_{3}x^{2} + c_{4}x^{3}+ c_{5}x^{4}$$ and its nested form as $$c_{1} + x(c_{2}+x(c_{3}+x(c_{4}+x(c_{5}))))$$
we can write a new form: $$c_{1} + (x-r_{1})(c_{2}+(x-r_{2})(c_{3}+(x-r_{3})(c_{4}+(x-r_{4})(c_{5}))))$$where $r_{1}...r_{4}$ are the **base points**.
