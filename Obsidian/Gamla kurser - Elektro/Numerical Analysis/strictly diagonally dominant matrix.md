# Strictly diagonally dominant
In numerical analysis, a matrix is said to be strictly diagonally dominant if the absolute value of the diagonal element in each row is greater than the sum of the absolute values of the other elements in the same row.
- Each main diagonal entry dominates its row in the sense that it is greater in magnitude than the sum of magnitudes of the remainder of the entries in its row
