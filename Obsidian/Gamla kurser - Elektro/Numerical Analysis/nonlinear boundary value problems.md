# Nonlinear boundary value problem
- Unlike linear boundary value problems, which can be solved using linear algebraic techniques, nonlinear boundary value problems require more sophisticated numerical methods to find approximate solutions. Nonlinear boundary value problems often involve nonlinearities such as nonlinear differential equations, nonlinear boundary conditions, or both, which makes their analysis and solution more challenging. Examples of nonlinear boundary value problems include problems in fluid dynamics, combustion, population dynamics, and control theory.
- A nonlinear differential equation is a differential equation that is not a linear equation in the unknown function y(x) or its derivatives.

Rather than solving a linear system as in [[linear boundary value problems]] we need to solve a nonlinear system $f(u) = 0$ where $f$ and $u$ are vector valued.
- We need to use [[Newton's method]].
