a) Use [[condition number]] formula, using the max [[matrix norm]].
b) Use [[perturbation analysis]]. Since 0.001 is added to every entry the max norm of $\delta B$ is 0.003. ![[Pasted image 20230530165105.png]]

a) $x_{n+1}=g(x_{n})$ where it is the given function. Iteratie with the starting value.
b) To prove its convergency, show the two criterias for it:![[Pasted image 20230523094156.png|550]]

Use the "book" formula instead of calculating each $\phi$ (faster). Note that there is three point which makes the formula a bit larger.

a) Either use the formula (from book) or memorize the "quicker" way:

b) Global error of composite trapezoidal rule is $\mathcal{O}(h^{2})$. Since $h= \frac{(b-a)}{N}$, the error asymptotically decreases proportionally to $\frac{1}{N^{2}}$ as N tends to infinity.

a) ![[Pasted image 20230523101259.png]]
b) The global truncation error of implicit Euler is $\mathcal{O}(h)$. This result also follows from that the backward Euler method has a local truncation error of $\mathcal{O}(h^{2})$. A global truncation error of $\mathcal{O}(h)$ means that the error asymptotically decreases proportional to h, as h tends to zero.
c) The formula is mathematically stable with $y(t) = 2e^{-50t}$ since it's bounded for all $t >0$. From the figure it's obvious that the numerical solution is not bounded as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Therefore the solution method is not numerically stable. Since the backward/implicit Euler method is numerically stable for all negative real parts of $h \lambda$ (the solution cannot grow in time when $\lambda$ is negative). Therefore the friend has not used the backward Euler, more like the forward Euler method.

Svar: The method is [[Jacobi method]] and x_out approximates the solution to the linear system.
